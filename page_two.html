        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <div class="motivation2">
            <p class="motivation2" id="motivation2">Intensity interferometry is part of optical interferometry, which provides a sub-milliarcsecond resolution of astronomical objects. 
                In intensity interferometry one correlates intensities of optical fluxes rather than amplitudes of waves.
               For a successful measurement one needs a large light collecting
               area for several telescopes separated
               by hundreds of meters and good time resolution of the intensity flux.
               Air Cherenkov telescopes, e.g., H.E.S.S. are a natural candidate for performing such a measurement.
               One of the important tasks is to determine the rate of photons hitting the PMTs to calculate expectations on the signal-to-noise ratio.
               For low rates, the individual pulses can be resolved and counted,
               but for high rates, relevant for the IACTs, the pulses from the photons overlap.
               We use different neural network algorithms in order to determine the rate
               of photons hitting the PMT, including the high rates.

            <p class="history" id="history">
                Machine learning methods can provide predictive models to solve complex problems either
with simulated or measured data, using classification or regression approach. In the last
decade, DL has been extensively used to solve various problems such as Natural Language
processing [Su14], speech recognition [Hi12] and Computer Vision [He16; LBH15; Su12].
Especially, Computer Vision methods have been used thoroughly in physics [Ch20; PP18].
In this work, we focused on various types of DL models such as Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
in order to determine the photon rates detected by PMTs. We compared the results with more traditional methods of estimating the photon rate: peak-finding method from scipy6
library and charge integration [21; Zm21]. The peak finding method provides good results
at low rates and underestimates the number of photons at high rates, when many peaks are
overlapping.

                <h2>Neural Network</h2>
                <p>Neural networks are made up of neurons, and these neurons are arranged in such a way
                    that they create layer like structure, in which each neurons has connection with previous
                    layer neurons and next layer neurons. These neurons have characteristic of computation
                    of input information and outputting result of these computations. Each computation includes two extra parameters, known as weight and bias, which determine the strength of
                    connection with previous or next layer. Thus, fist
                    weight matrix is used for first layer, and out from first layer is used as input for next layer
                    with which again new weight matrix is initialized and used in universal approximation
                    of second layer. Similarly for deeper network, one-by-one layer use their respective initialized weight matrix for the calculation of feature importance.</p>

                <h2>Optimizer</h2>
                <p>With the help of BP algorithm NNs calculate the required gradient for weight updates, but
                    do not specify the way of their use in order to implement update of weights. Optimizers
                    fullfils this requirement. There are various gradient based learning-algorithms.</p>

                <h2>Loss function</h2>
                <p>Loss function is the function which compares by mapping an output values of model with
                    truth values, which is further used for optimisation of model parameters. In general, one
                    might need to maximize or minimize the loss function according to nature of function
                    used. Once the loss function is calculated, the closeness of the NN predictions must be
                    estimated, here helps the maximum likelihood function. Advantage of maximum likelihood is that with the number of training examples the model prediction improves, and
                    this property is known as "Consistency". Though, this is helpful for the case of NNs till
                    certain point, after that all what depends is the selection of model architecture, loss optimizers and hyperparameter tuning. Selection of loss function is related to activation function
                    of last layer.</p>

                Fully Connected Neural Networks are the simplest neural networks, which consist of layers of neurons working on basic principle. In it each of the neurons from one ´layer is
connected to each of the neurons of other neurons., In this way it forms fully connected architecture. This proliferates number of parameters of the network, which sometimes cause
overfitting. The improvisation of prediction requires optimisation of parameters, which is possible by
use of Back-propagation algorithm(BP). It simply calculates partial derivatives of C with respect to θ and determines required updates in θ for minimization of C. Since intermediate
quantities such as activation(output of nodes) has influence on final prediction. Thus, one
needs to consider them in recursive calculation of partial derivatives of C with respect to
θ. This is the basic idea of BP in NNs.

                In general, convolution is a mathematical operation applied on two functions and the result of this implementation gives third function, which determines that how shape of one
function depends on other function’s shape. Neural network which simply uses "Convolution" instead of matrix multiplication is known as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).
Until the 1960s and 1970s, NNs were just simple connections of neurons which pass
the information by getting activated, and depending on the problem and the NN connection, the computing process was done in different stages. Also during this time for
supervised learning, efficient gradient descent method was used and backpropagation(BP)
was developed in order to achieve optimization in training in both SL and UL3
, which
was found very difficult in practice in 1980 but applied first time in 1981, and by the
1990 it became an explicit research subject. BP works on simple concept of chain rule[17]
applied on parameter space with iterations which results Steepest descent[18]. Also, in
case of time series prediction and sequence classification, BP plays vital role[19]. In 1979,
Kunihiko Fukushima proposed an idea of multi-layer hierarchical neural network for pattern recognition and handwritten digit recognition, which was known as Neocognitron
NN and became inspiration for CNNs later on[20].

                <div class="text" id="text">
                    First it takes input sequences and process them and store some information in
memory called hidden state. It passes this stored information to next time cell. Now in
next cell, information obtained from previous cell’s hidden state and input information of
present cell get added in the form of vector. Thus, formed vector has information of previous state and current input. Now, this vector is scaled in tanh function which is simply the
memory(calculated hidden state) of present state. Benefit of tanh function is that is results values in between -1 and +1, instead of exploding values by multiplications. This is how
RNN works. LSTM cell has the similar working principle, but with much more complicated mathematical operations, which allows LSTM to keep relevant information and forget irrelevant
ones. In the heart of computations in LSTM are calculation of cell state and gates. One can
consider cell state as a highway, which passes important information in entire sequence,
which means information from earlier states are also used by last states in sequence, and
helps in reduction of short-term memory. Through-out the sequence, information gets added into cell states by gated calculations in cells of sequence. In gates sigmoid activation
is used, which scales information from 0 to 1, which is helpful to extract information to
forget. Because information multiplied with closer to 1 gets more importance while information multiplied by closer to 0 gets less importance. Basically, LSTM cells have three
different gates, forget gate, input gate and output gate.
