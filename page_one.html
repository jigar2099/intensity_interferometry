            <h2>Intensity Interferometry</h2>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p class="motivation" id="motivation">Our understanding of stars comes from high angular resolution results from star’s light
                spectrum and variability, for which several attempts are done utilizing many advanced
                optical instruments including extremely large telescopes. The highest resolution so far is
                obtained by amplitude interferometers, with very long baseline, which are prefered to
                be operated in the near infrared since atmospheric turbulence have less effect on longer
                wavelengths. However, they are constrained by atmospheric turbulance. Intensity interferometry, an alternative approach to amplitude interferometry, is a method to achive higher
                angular resolution without results being affected by atmospheric turbulence
            </p>

            <h2 >Brief history and early development</h2>
            <p class="history" id="history">
                Measuring the angular diameter of is 400 years old problem. Galileo measured distance
        to the Vega and placed an upper limit on its angular size, by mentioning in his report
        the angular size of Vega as 5 arc-second with consideration of atmospheric scintillation.
        Newton also measured the angular size of stars and estimated angular size(upper bound)
        of Vega to be 2 miliarcseconds(mas), which is very close to actual angular size. By the late
        1800 it was realized that the maximum angular resolution of around 1 miliarcsecond is
        determined by the atmospheric turbulence, instead of by the size of the aperture.
            </p>

            <p class="history1" id="history1">
                Around 1874, M. Stephan implemented this
        experiment with 80 cm telescope, and saw generated fringes in the stellar observation, and
        provided angular resolution upper limit by an order of 0.16 arc-seconds for stars. Later on,
        Michelson and Pease, in 1920, at Mt. Wilson had performed first successful measurement
        of angular diameter of star, which is considered as birth of high resolution astronomy[1].
        With 36” telescope, Michelson measured the angular diameter of Jupiter’s Galilean moons.
        In 1920, they also measured angular diameter of the Berelgeuse(47 mas) with 6m of interferometer baseline[1]. In the preliminary experiments of Michelson, he noticed the drift in
        fringes, which occurred due to atmospheric turbulence effects, inducing path difference
        between two beams. Michelson measured this drift time scale as of order of milliseconds.
        In 1930, Pease developed 15m version of their previous imterferometer, but unfortunately
        the experiment failed to provide convincing results and indicated for the need of very
        high precision optics, and then was abandoned. Later on, it took around 30 years for next
        breakthrough in optical interferometry.

            <p class="history2" id="history2">
                First attempt to investigate coherence theory, was by Verdet in 1865, who measured
        coherence(transverse) length of sun as 0.1mm by measuring angular diameter of sun[2].
        The crucial time for the development of coherence theory was in between 1920 and 1960.
        In this duration several notorious scientists, such as, Hopkins, Wolf, Weiner, Van Cittert,
        Zernike, have investigated and outcome of their efforts was quantification of correlation
        between space-time fluctuations and degree of coherence, which is obtained by Fourier
        transform of radiant distribution of star, which is known as Cittert-Zernicke theorem, and
        was first applied in radio astronomy by M.Ryle in 1952[3]. By the time radio interferometry
        had implemented modern techniques and improved understanding of coherence theory,
        which gave boost for development of intensity interferometry, and provided most highest
        angular resolution images till today.
